When I was playing around with the code, I was moving the particles. I made them bigger. I solved the challenge by looking at the code, and making it as my own style.

I used this procressing. I solved the challenge by looking at the code, what it does, and creating my own work with processing. I love how the shapes cover the whole screen and I have my own name on it.
