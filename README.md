I was working on processing and I made my work with particles. When I was playing around with the code, I was moving the particles. I made them bigger. I solved the challenge by looking at the code, and making it as my own style.

I used this procressing. I solved the challenge by looking at the code, what it does, and creating my own work with processing. I love how the shapes cover the whole screen and I have my own name on it.

I made my own character using processing. I made the background red because that is my favorite color. I made his face blue. It looks cool to me. I solved the challenge by changing some things in the code to make my character look cool.

I did a lot of them because I enjoyed it. This screenshot was being worked on from procressing. There are 100,000 boxes in the screenshot. I solved the challenge by creating my own unique experimental piece.
